## **Circular Modal Transition Notes**

The idea behind making this circular animation work is that when we tap on the button, we need to understand its frame. We need to use that frame to create a mask, and that mask will start sitting on top of the button, and expand and take over the entire viewController. And that will expose and reveal the controller weâ€™re transitioning onto.

So the first thing we need to do is expand the frame of the button.
